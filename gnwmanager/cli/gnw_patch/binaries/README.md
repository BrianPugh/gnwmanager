These binaries were generated by calling the following commands in the https://github.com/BrianPugh/game-and-watch-patch repository.

These binaries contain **only compiled novel code; no nintendo firmware is included in these binaries**.
These are contained in this package so that users do not have to compile or download a toolchain.

CI is **not** setup to recompile these binaries, primarily because it makes local development a bit more annoying (developers for `gnwmanager` would then need to clone & build `game-and-watch-patch` as well).
